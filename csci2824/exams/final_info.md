Final Exam Information 
=

**Time**/**Date**: 11. May from 7:30-10:00pm in GOLD A2B70  

Overview and Rules  
--------
- The final exam is cumulative but you are guaranteed to see questions on relations, graphs, and trees, since those topics did not appear on the Quizzes. This includes all material presented in lecture or introduced in homework
- You are allowed **ONE** 8-1/2 x 11in sheet of **handwritten** notes (both sides).  No magnifying glasses! 
- A calculator is strongly recommended.   Any calculator that cannot access the internet or store large amounts of data may be used. Smartphones may **NOT** be used as calculators.
- The exam will be a mixture of multiple choice questions and free-response questions in which you may be asked to do calculations, step through algorithms, etc.  I will **NOT** ask you to write code or pseudocode. 
- **IMPORTANT**: We will be using Scantron forms for the multiple choice questions.  Please bring a Number 2 pencil to the exam.
