    "This assignment is due on D2L by 11:59pm on **Thursday, June 22nd**. Your solutions to the written exercises should be completed in Markdown directly in this Jupyter Notebook.  Ideally, your solutions to the programming problems should be written directly in the notebook as well, but if you like you can write your functions in a $\\texttt{.jl}$ script and then load your script into the notebook.
