    "This assignment is due on D2L by 11:59pm on **Thursday, June 15th**. Your solutions to the written exercises should be completed in Markdown directly in this Jupyter Notebook.  Ideally, your solutions to the programming problems should be written directly in the notebook as well, but if you like you can write your functions in a $\\texttt{.jl}$ script and then load your script into the notebook.

    "### Problem 1: Neumann Boundary Conditions \n",
    "Consider the 1D Model Problem subject to the _Neumann boundary conditions_ $u'(0) = u'(1) = 0$.  Find the system of linear equations that results when second-order finite difference are used to discretize this problem at the grid points $x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_n$.  At the boundary points $x_0$ and $x_n$, one of the many ways to incorporate the boundary conditions is to let $v_1 = v_0$ and $v_{n-1} = v_n$.  How many equations and how many unknowns are there in this problem? Give the matrix that corresponds to this boundary value problem. "
